## Context and Data

Before proceeding, install the `rpart` and `rpart.plot` packages (for building and plotting decision trees) by entering `install.packages(c("rpart", "rpart.plot"))` in the Console. 

Our goal will be to classify types of urban land cover in small subregions within a high resolution aerial image of a land region. Data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Urban+Land+Cover) include the observed type of land cover (determined by human eye) and "spectral, size, shape, and texture information" computed from the image. See [this page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Urban+Land+Cover) for the data codebook.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(rpart.plot)

# Read in the data
land <- read_csv("https://www.macalester.edu/~ajohns24/data/land_cover.csv")

# There are 9 land types, but we'll focus on 3 of them
land <- land %>% 
    filter(class %in% c("asphalt", "grass", "tree"))
```


## Exercise 1: Core theme: parametric/nonparametric

a. What does it mean for a method to be nonparametric? In general, when might we prefer nonparametric to parametric methods? When might we not?

b. Where do you think trees fall on the parametric/nonparametric spectrum?



## Exercise 2: Core theme: Tuning parameters and the BVT

The key feature governing complexity of a tree model is the number of splits used in the tree. How is the number of splits related to model complexity, bias, and variance?

In practice, the number of splits is controlled indirectly through the following tuning parameters. For each, discuss how low/high parameter settings would affect the number of tree splits.

- `minsplit`: the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted.

- `minbucket`: the minimum number of observations in any leaf node.

- `cp`: complexity parameter. Any split that does not increase node purity by `cp` is not attempted.

- `maxdepth`: Set the maximum **depth** of any node of the final tree. The **depth** of a node is the number of branches that need to be followed to get to a given node from the root node. (The root node has depth 0.)



## Exercise 3: Building trees in `caret`

Fit a tree model for the `class` outcome (land type), and allow all possible predictors to be considered (`~ .` in the model formula).

- Use 10-fold CV.
- Choose a final model whose test overall accuracy is within one standard error of the overall best metric.
- The Gini index impurity measure can be a minimum of zero and has an upper bound of 1. Thus, we'll try a sequence of 50 `cp` values from 0 to 0.5.

Make a plot of test performance versus the `cp` tuning parameter. Does it look as you expected?

```{r}
set.seed(___)
tree_mod <- train(

)
```



## Exercise 4: Visualizing trees

Let's visualize the difference between the trees learned under `cp` parameters. The code below fits a tree for a lower than optimal `cp` value (`tree_mod_lowcp`) and a higher than optimal `cp` (`tree_mod_highcp`). We then plot these trees (1st and 3rd) along with our best tree (2nd).

Look at page 3 of the `rpart.plot` [package vignette](http://www.milbo.org/doc/prp.pdf) (an example-heavy manual) to understand what the plot components mean.

```{r}
tree_mod_lowcp <- train(
    class ~ .,
    data = land,
    method = "rpart",
    tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = 0),
    trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10),
    metric = "Accuracy",
    na.action = na.omit
)
tree_mod_highcp <- train(
    class ~ .,
    data = land,
    method = "rpart",
    tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = 0.1),
    trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10),
    metric = "Accuracy",
    na.action = na.omit
)

# Plot all 3 trees in a row
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
rpart.plot(tree_mod_lowcp$finalModel)
rpart.plot(tree_mod$finalModel)
rpart.plot(tree_mod_highcp$finalModel)
```

- Verify for a couple of splits the idea of increasing node purity/homogeneity in tree-building. (How is this idea reflected in the numbers in the plot output?)

- Tuning classification trees (like with the `cp` parameter) is also referred to as **"pruning"**. Why does this make sense? NOTE: If "pruning" is a new word to you, first Google it.
