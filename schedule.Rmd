# Schedule {-}

The schedule below is a tentative outline of our plans for the semester.

**Before each class period, please watch the indicated videos and check on your understanding by actively reviewing the associated [Learning Goals](learning-goals.html).** The readings listed below are optional but serve as a nice complement to the videos and class activities. Readings refer to chapters/sections in the Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR) textbook (available online [here](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf)).

**Remember to take notes on where you paused/rewound/reread or smiled/nodded during the videos/readings.** This is essential for the **Metacognitive Reflection** part of the course.
