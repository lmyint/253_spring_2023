# Splines in `tidymodels`

To build models with splines in `tidymodels`, we proceed with the same structure as we use for ordinary linear regression models but we'll add some pre-processing steps to our `recipe`.

To work with splines, we'll use tools from the `splines` package.

- The `ns()` function in the `splines` package implements the variable transformations needed to create a natural cubic spline function for a quantitative predictor.
- The `step_ns()` function in `tidymodels` is an interface to `ns()`.

```{r}
# Linear regression model specification
lm_spec <- 
    linear_reg() %>%
    set_engine(engine = "lm") %>%
    set_mode("regression") 

# Recipe: linear regression model
lm_rec <- recipe(___ ~ ___, data = ___)

# Recipe: linear regression model with natural splines
ns_rec <- lm_rec %>%
    step_ns(__, deg_free = __) # natural cubic spline for a given predictor (higher deg_free means more knots)
```

- The `deg_free` argument in `step_ns()` stands for degrees of freedom:
    - `deg_free = # knots + 1`
    - The degrees of freedom are the number of coefficients in the transformation functions that are free to vary (essentially the number of underlying parameters behind the transformations).
    - The knots are chosen using percentiles of the observed values.
    





# Exercises

Before proceeding, install the `splines` package by entering `install.packages("splines")` in the Console.

We'll continue using the `College` dataset in the `ISLR2` package to explore splines. You can use `?College` in the Console to look at the data codebook.

```{r}
library(ISLR2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidymodels) 
tidymodels_prefer() # Resolves conflicts, prefers tidymodel functions

data(College)

# Data cleaning
college_clean <- College %>% 
    mutate(school = rownames(College)) %>% # creates variable with school name
    filter(Grad.Rate <= 100) # Remove one school with grad rate of 118%
rownames(college_clean) <- NULL # Remove school names as row names
```


## Exercise 1: Evaluating a fully linear model

We will model `Grad.Rate` as a function of 4 predictors: `Private`, `Terminal`, `Expend`, and `S.F.Ratio`.

a. Make scatterplots of the quantitative predictors and the outcome with 2 different smoothing lines to explore potential nonlinearity. Adapt the following code to create a scatterplot with a smooth (curved) blue trend line and a red linear trend line.

```{r}
ggplot(___, aes(___)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(color = "blue", se = FALSE) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
    theme_classic()
```

b. Use `tidymodels` to fit a LASSO model (no splines yet) with the following specifications:
    - Use 8-fold CV.
    - Just use the 4 predictors `Private`, `Terminal`, `Expend`, and `S.F.Ratio`.
    - Use CV mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate models.
    - Use the LASSO engine (`"glmnet"`) to do variable selection to select the simplest model for which the metric is within one standard error of the best metric.
    - Fit your "best" model and look at coefficients of that final model.

```{r}
# NOTE: If you get stuck when writing this code, check the solutions code chunk below
set.seed(___)

# Create CV folds
data_cv8 <- vfold_cv(___, v = ___)

# Lasso Model Spec with tune
lm_lasso_spec_tune <- 
    linear_reg() %>%
    set_args(mixture = 1, penalty = tune()) %>% ## mixture = 1 indicates Lasso
    set_engine(engine = ___) %>% 
    set_mode("regression") 

# Recipe
full_rec <- recipe(___ ~ ___, data = college_clean) %>%
    step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
    step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

# Workflow (Recipe + Model)
lasso_wf_tune <- workflow() %>% 
    add_recipe(full_rec) %>%
    add_model(lm_lasso_spec_tune) 

# Tune Model (trying a variety of values of Lambda penalty)
penalty_grid <- grid_regular(
    penalty(range = c(-3, 1)), # log10 transformed 
    levels = 30
)

tune_output <- tune_grid( 
    lasso_wf_tune, # workflow
    resamples = data_cv8, # cv folds
    metrics = metric_set(___),
    grid = penalty_grid # penalty grid defined above
)

# Select best model & fit
best_penalty <- tune_output %>% 
    select_by_one_std_err(metric = "mae", desc(penalty))

lasso_mod <- finalize_workflow(lasso_wf_tune, best_penalty) %>%
    fit(data = college_clean)

# Note which variable is the "least" important    
lasso_mod %>% tidy()
```

```{r solutions1, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# SOLUTIONS code chunk - check here if you need help with the implementation above
# Delete this chunk when you're finished implementing Exercise 1b (just to keep your Rmd neat)
set.seed(YOUR_FAVORITE_NUMBER)

# Create CV folds
data_cv8 <- vfold_cv(college_clean, v = 8)

# Lasso Model Spec with tune
lm_lasso_spec_tune <- 
    linear_reg() %>%
    set_args(mixture = 1, penalty = tune()) %>% ## mixture = 1 indicates Lasso
    set_engine(engine = "glmnet") %>% 
    set_mode("regression") 

# Recipe
full_rec <- recipe(Grad.Rate ~ Private + Terminal + Expend + S.F.Ratio, data = college_clean) %>%
    step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
    step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

# Workflow (Recipe + Model)
lasso_wf_tune <- workflow() %>% 
    add_recipe(full_rec) %>%
    add_model(lm_lasso_spec_tune) 

# Tune Model (trying a variety of values of Lambda penalty)
penalty_grid <- grid_regular(
    penalty(range = c(-3, 1)), # log10 transformed 
    levels = 30
)

tune_output <- tune_grid( 
    lasso_wf_tune, # workflow
    resamples = data_cv8, # cv folds
    metrics = metric_set(mae),
    grid = penalty_grid # penalty grid defined above
)

# Select best model & fit
best_penalty <- tune_output %>% 
    select_by_one_std_err(metric = "mae", desc(penalty))

lasso_mod <- finalize_workflow(lasso_wf_tune, best_penalty) %>%
    fit(data = college_clean)

# Note which variable is the "least" important    
lasso_mod %>% tidy()
```

c. Make plots of the residuals vs. the 3 quantitative predictors to evaluate the appropriateness of linear terms.

```{r}
# NOTE: If you get stuck when writing this code, check the solutions code chunk below
lasso_mod_output <- college_clean %>%
    bind_cols(predict(lasso_mod, new_data = college_clean)) %>%
    mutate(resid = ___ - ___)

ggplot(lasso_mod_output, aes(___)) +
    ___ +
    ___ +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") + 
    theme_classic()
```

```{r solutions2, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# SOLUTIONS code chunk - check here if you need help with the implementation above
# Delete this chunk when you're finished (just to keep your Rmd neat)
# Residual plot for the Terminal predictor
ggplot(lasso_mod_output, aes(x = Terminal, y = resid)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
    theme_classic()
```


## Exercise 2: Evaluating a spline model

We'll extend our best linear regression model with spline functions of the quantitative predictors (leave `Private` as is).

a. What tuning parameter is associated with splines? How do high/low values of this parameter relate to bias and variance?

b. Update your recipe from Exercise 1 to fit a linear model (with the `lm` engine rather than LASSO) with the 2 best quantitative predictors with natural splines that have 2 knots (= 3 degrees of freedom) and include `Private`. Fit this model with CV, `fit_resamples`, (same folds as before) to compare MAE and then fit the model to the whole training data. Call this fit model `ns_mod`.

```{r}
# NOTE: If you get stuck when writing this code, check the solutions code chunk below

# Model Spec
lm_spec <-
    linear_reg() %>%
    set_engine(engine = "lm") %>%
    set_mode("regression")

# New Recipe (remove steps needed for LASSO, add splines)
spline_rec <- recipe(___ ~ ___, data = ___) %>%
    step___() # INSERT_ONE_OR_MORE_steps_here

# Workflow (Recipe + Model)
spline_wf <- workflow() %>%
    add_???() %>%
    add_???()

# CV to Evaluate
cv_output <- fit_resamples(
    ___, # workflow
    resamples = data_cv8, # cv folds
    metrics = metric_set(___)
)

cv_output %>% collect_metrics()

# Fit with all data
ns_mod <- fit(
    ___, # workflow
    data = college_clean
)
```

```{r solutions3, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# SOLUTIONS code chunk - check here if you need help with the implementation above
# Delete this chunk when you're finished (just to keep your Rmd neat)

# New Recipe (LASSO steps removed, spline steps added)
spline_rec <- recipe(Grad.Rate ~ Private + Terminal + Expend + S.F.Ratio, data = college_clean) %>%
    step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
    step_ns(Terminal, deg_free = 3) %>%
    step_ns(Expend, deg_free = 3)

# Workflow (Recipe + Model)
spline_wf <- workflow() %>% 
    add_recipe(spline_rec) %>%
    add_model(lm_spec)

# CV to Evaluate
cv_output <- fit_resamples( 
    spline_wf, # workflow
    resamples = data_cv8, # cv folds
    metrics = metric_set(mae)
)

# Fit model
ns_mod <- fit(
    spline_wf, # workflow
    data = college_clean
)
```

c. Make plots of the residuals vs. the 3 quantitative predictors to evaluate if splines improved the model.

```{r}
# NOTE: If you get stuck when writing this code, check the solutions code chunk below
spline_mod_output <- ___


# Residual plots

```

```{r solutions4, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# SOLUTIONS code chunk - check here if you need help with the implementation above
# Delete this chunk when you're finished (just to keep your Rmd neat)

spline_mod_output <- college_clean %>%
    bind_cols(predict(ns_mod, new_data = college_clean)) %>%
    mutate(resid = Grad.Rate - .pred)

ggplot(spline_mod_output, aes(x = Terminal, y = resid)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
    theme_classic()
```

d. Compare the CV MAE between models with and without the splines.

```{r}
tune_output %>%
    collect_metrics() %>%
    filter(penalty == (best_penalty %>% pull(penalty)))

cv_output %>% collect_metrics()
```

## Extra! Variable scaling

What is your intuition about whether variable scaling matters for the performance of splines?

Check you intuition by reusing code from Exercise 2, except by adding in `step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())` before `step_ns()`. Call this `ns_mod2`.

How do the predictions from `ns_mod` and `ns_mod2` compare? You could use a plot to compare or check out the `all.equal()` function.

```{r}
all.equal(spline_mod_output$.pred, spline_mod_output2$.pred)
plot(spline_mod_output$.pred, spline_mod_output2$.pred)
```
